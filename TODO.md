# Things left to do

- Implement [Lagrangian Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04630).

## Clean up code
- Discuss how to organize tests: GPU tests, optimizer tests, network tests, array tests, kernel tests (and corresponding AD ruless), comparisons with other packages (Lux, Flux, Optimisers.jl, ...)
- Write examples!!! (Jupyter notebook?) -> this is probably best done after we have the new neural network framework.
