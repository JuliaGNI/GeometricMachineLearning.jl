## Symplectic Solution Manifold 

In Hamiltonian reduced order modelling we try to find a symplectic submanifold of the solution space: $\tilde{\mathcal{M}} = \{\Psi^\mathrm{dec}(z_r)\in\mathbb{R}^{2N}:u_r\in\mathrm{R}^{2n}\}$ where $z_r$ is the reduced state of the system. 

The solution of the PDE always evolves on the solution manifold, and in case of a Hamiltonian PDE this evolution can be described through a Hamiltonian ODE.
