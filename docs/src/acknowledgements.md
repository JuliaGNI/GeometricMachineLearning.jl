# Preliminary Remarks and Acknowledgements

During the time I conducted my PhD the The TUM School of Computation, Information, and Technology (CIT) replaced former departments of Mathematics, Informatics, and Electrical and Computer Engineering. Its mission statement reads: "[CIT unites] a wide spectrum of different competencies:
- from theoretical foundations to implementation in different contexts of application,
- from elementary components via hardware and software architectures to holistic technical systems,
- from mathematical abstraction to technological engineering processes,
- from formal specification to partially automated implementation."

Although not touching on all these aspects, I tried to make my dissertation fit into this framework: it is closely linked to the development of a software package that can be used "in different contexts of application" and contains algorithms that emerged as a result of "mathematical abstraction". In this spirit this text contains both code snippets demonstrating the software package and mathematical theorems (including proofs). 

This work would not have been possible without the excellent supervision and academic environment I found myself in. My foremost thanks go to my scientific mentor Michael Kraus who throughout my PhD provided me with guidance, nudged me in the right direction when I needed it, and was extremely understanding whenever progress was slow. He almost always gave me the maximum amount of freedom to pursue things I found interesting. The only instance I can think of, where this freedom was not granted, is his insistence that all his students use Julia, a demand that sped up my progress immensely.

I am also very grateful to Eric Sonnendr√ºcker, the head of our department, who gave me many opportunities to present my work at international conferences which gave me the opportunity to meet new people (very often the faces behind the papers I read) and exchange ideas.

On a more personal note I want to thank my parents for their patience, understanding and relentless encouragement; I often think back to my father telling me: "Irgendwie geht's immer."

Lastly I want to thank my girlfriend Lejie for her love and support, remarks that very often helped me organize thoughts in my head, and her extreme understanding when I opened my laptop for the umpteenth time for a late-night programming session.
