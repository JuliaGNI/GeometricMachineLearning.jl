# Acknowledgements and Preliminary Remarks



I want to thank my parents for their patience, understanding and relentless encouragement; I often think back to my father telling me: "Irgendwie geht's immer."

Lastly I want to express my sincere gratitude towards my girlfriend Lejie for her helpful remarks that very often helped me organize thoughts in my head, her emotional as well as practical support, and her extreme understanding when I opened my laptop for the umpteenth time for a late-night programming session.
